# Basic_Pavlovian_TDRL
MATLAB function for modeling Pavlovian behavioral paradigms using the one-step temporal difference reinforcement learning algorithm

The function sim_TDRL_DA_Inact simulates the behavioral paradigms described in the Maes et al. paper found on biorxiv at doi:https://doi.org/10.1101/520965 using the linearTDRL_DA function which implements a TD(0) algorithm with linear function approximation.
